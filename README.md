# Glove Defect Detection
## 1.0 Learning Outcomes
CLO 1: 	Understand various operations in image processing and computer vision techniques.<br>
CLO 2: 	Demonstrate suitable image processing techniques for given image analysis problem using appropriate tools.<br>
CLO 3: 	Interpret the solutions developed against contemporary approaches in computer vision and pattern recognition.<br>

## 2.0. Requirements
Identify defects in the glove such as shown in figure 1. Minimum 3 defects must be identified.<br>
You will need to survey and select candidate techniques to be used in the project. Provide justification for the choices made, including in and libraries and data used. A detailed explanation must be given on this method with proper calculation to support your design if necessary. <br>
The system must not be sensitive to environmental changes. Haar Cascade, Tensorflow and pattern matching methods should not be used. <br>
